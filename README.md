Image Resizer with Azure Blob Storage & GitHub Actions CI/CD
Hey there! This project is a simple Python tool that resizes images stored in Azure Blob Storage. It takes your original images, makes them smaller or bigger (whichever you want), and saves the resized copies back to the cloud.

Also, it has an automated pipeline using GitHub Actions so you can easily test and deploy it without hassle.
